Topic: Brainstorming ideas for the project language.

Summary: We discussed potential ideas for the language we will be creating:
1. A "graph" language that fascilitates handling of graph data structure.
2. A "mechanics" language that helps calculation in terms of mechanical physics.
3. A form processing/generating language that makes it easy to generate a form(for things like
survey), and process the statistics contained within a form.

Now everything really sounds just like extra libraries, we are trying to come up with something that
can qualify our project as a new "language"; also, a general-purpose langauge seems way too complex,
and we will probably focus on DSL.
